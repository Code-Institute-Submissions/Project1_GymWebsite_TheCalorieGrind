# User Centric Frontend Development Project - "The Calorie Grind" Gym Website

The Calorie Grind is a gym set up with the aims of having an environment that is open to everyone while at the same time professional. The main aim is to reassure new customers that the gym puts their mental health first through positive statements such as the ones outlined in the Mission section on the first page. 

The website itself offers all of the key information needed to to see what the gym is about, what classes are being taken, availability, where to find the gym and how to get started via a submission form. On top of this all contact details and social medias are provided at the footer section of every page.  

# UX

For the user experience I wanted to ensure that it was simple for the potential customer to access all information as fast as possible. 

Through the drop down menu all information is available within 3 clicks of opening the website. It is layed out in order so as one goes through the website step by step they get to the final page with all the information they need. 

The index page greets the user with a burn animation upon loading which is then a reoccuring theme in each page following. My idea around this was to subliminally incentise the idea of when you come to the page you are there to burn calories reflecting the gym logo itself The Calorie Grind. This is followed by inspirational messages with the intent of making the user feel comfortable as the gym experience for most new users often is wrapped in some form of anxiety/nervousness.
